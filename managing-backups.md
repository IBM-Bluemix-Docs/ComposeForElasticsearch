## Backup contents

{{site.data.keyword.composeForElasticsearch}} backups are taken with the snapshot utility in the Elasticsearch API. The process is executed on the entire cluster in non-blocking fashion so all indexing and search operations can continue normally while it is running. It makes a point-in-time backup at the moment when the snapshot is created.
